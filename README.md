#Bank Marketing

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a European banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

Analysed the bank marketing data, found data patterns and cleaned the data for further modeling to help the banking institution determine, in advance, clients who will be receptive to marketing campaigns. Also, evaluated the performance of the deployed model.
